# Stardate
A web-based application that uses trigonometric functions to provide non-linear and non-random numbers as substitutes for Gregorian Calendar dates.

This application provides numbers that are "Stardates" and uses alternating-color table rows to display corresponding Gregorian dates.

Once the date is calulated, the application uses a decimal to display the time of day, similar to Star Trek. That decimal portion is tacked on to the Stardate number. For example, at midnight, you may have Stardate 6327.00, and at noon, you would have Stardate 6327.50, and at 4:44pm, you would have Stardate 6327.70.

Be bold, and be the Captain of your ship! Feel free to record a Captain's Log with your own Stardates, just like in "Star Trek!"

This application makes minimal use of jQuery and v1.11.3 is included.

Also included:

-index.html file to view the data
-script.js the JavaScript that includes the equations to generate the numbers and the instructions to display them
-styles.css style information
